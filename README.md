# shoko - David Azaria / January 2018

## What is shoko?
My interest in language developed from a young age. Coming from a multilingual / multicultural home, my interest in language was almost predetermined for me. And as a person interested in recognizing and exploiting patterns in rather inane subjects, one might say a project like this one has been a culmination of not just my time at General Assembly, but rather life as a whole. 

And parrying off of that thought is what begotten "shoko", which is the Shona word for, well, "word". I do not speak Shona -- in fact, I might not have been able to tell you where Shona was spoken before starting my work on this app; however, now knowing a bit more about Shona, and I suppose myself, I can tell you that from a meta-perspective, I'm not surprised I spent quite a bit of time reading about its origins and relationship to other Bantu languages. But let's move on to the app itself and why I think it is important...

I am not sure whether this is an overstatement or understatement, but I think we all take the power of language for granted. Think about the strength behind choosing one word over the other. And think about for a moment how we derived those words. Why those sounds? Why do we conjugate? Why does inflection matter? And what the heck is grammar? 

shoko aims to dispel some of those myths for you with an easy to use application giving you the power to learn more about the words you choose, e.g. their etymology, their grammatical classes, etc. Future iterations of the app will allow you to use everyday language and words to command a structured query language (SQL) to produce data insights into your business. More TK come there.
